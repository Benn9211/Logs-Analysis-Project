### This is the third project for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. In this project, a large database with over a million rows is explored by building complex SQL queries to draw business conclusions for the data. The project mimics building an internal reporting tool for a newpaper site to discover what kind of articles the site's readers like. The database contains newspaper articles, as well as the web server log for the site.
